     <h1>About Me</h1>
     <p>Born and raised in Oregon, I was homeschooled k-12. 
        I began building computers in middle school, 
        and started coding at the age of 16. 
        I've always loved computers and learning the philosophy 
        behind programing languages and algorithms always fascinated me.
        My first project was making a Minecraft mod, I did not get far into 
        coding the mod before abandoning it to try something easier.
        I settled on building mobile apps with Android Studio, and I am
        currently in the process of developing a mobile game for my kids. </p>
